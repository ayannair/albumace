            "lyrics": "There's tons of cringey clips of him all over the internet doing God knows what, but we're currently living in an era where online content creators are building scary huge platforms and with 21 million YouTube subscribers, KSI is one of those guys. Sounds like he cares about whether or not his choruses are hitting his well. It's not like he's just hopping on a track and casually riffing for two or three minutes and then it's just over without much of a hook and sight. There is a good feature on the track, a slick hook, some really punchy beats too. I mean I get the sentiments of the song that money can't buy happiness and that's no replacement for this miss or broken personal relationship or connection that you had going on but without some song writing ability to translate the pain of that you're not communicating much which leaves me worried post this record about KSI's future in music because translating such a sentiment in a song is a pretty necessary skill for having a long term music career. ",
            "production": "He has all the money in the world to throw at a studio project decked out with features from Rick Ross and little baby and trippy red and offset the sound of this project is pretty high grade too. Specifically, the production, the vocals run pretty much like what you might catch on your average trap record that would land on the front of Apple Music or in a popular Spotify playlist. He's got some nice bass in his range as well. Honestly, if I didn't know who this was from the sound of this record and the look of the track list and the vibe of the instrumentals, I would assume this was a major label project with a big budget behind it from an artist who does this professionally. In fairness to KSI, I will say it does sound like he put some effort into his verse and he's certainly not mumbling his way through them. Sounds like he cares about whether or not his choruses are hitting his well. We also have a very clubby dance hall track with the song Houdini speaking of trackless here that feel a little focus group like we have to have this vibe and that vibe, this style and that style go for this sound and that sound. But JJ actually sounds pretty comfortable over this style of song. There is a good feature on the track, a slick hook, some really punchy beats too. Now a feature from these two is a bit dated at this point but it is a pretty grimy banger with eerie production. No where near is raw as the early soundclouds stuff that put these guys on the map, but the similar energy there that KSI effectively plays off of with his performance on the track pretty well. The track bad little vibe is another moment that sounds like a blatant Travis Scott rip off but not even Travis Scott. Now she's sounding like chubaca when she back it up. I can't imagine what that would sound like. We then have the last leg of the record which in my opinion is a mixed bag. The track undefeated where it sounds like KSI is wrapping his ass off a little bit with a lot of passion that's great but the vocals are mixed incredibly low on this cut and they are slathered in auto tune 2 which makes it difficult to really connect with them in any meaningful way. We then get the worst for last though on the track millions where KSI is sounding absolutely combatose or maybe overcome with emotion I can't quite tell but what really ruins the track right from the start are these tune lists, auto tune vocal leads that are overlapping each other hideously.

            "features": "He has all the money in the world to throw at a studio project decked out with features from Rick Ross and little baby and trippy red and offset the sound of this project is pretty high grade too. There is a good feature on the track, a slick hook, some really punchy beats too. With some tracks here, KSI seems to have a decent sense of what makes for a good song in a certain vibe, namely the track poppin featuring little pump and smoke perp. Now a feature from these two is a bit dated at this point but it is a pretty grimy banger with eerie production. It's one thing for him to pull these big features on this project but it will be game time the day a large artist decides you know what my record cannot do without a KSI feature. ",
            "vocals": "Specifically, the production, the vocals run pretty much like what you might catch on your average trap record that would land on the front of Apple Music or in a popular Spotify playlist. But comparing KSI to some of his YouTube contemporaries who have also tried to step into music, his rapping and vocal delivery is a lot more convincing than a Jake Paul or like a rice gum who have both dropped tracks that have done massive numbers on the platform. But to anyone who is actually a music fan and not just a rice gum or a Jake Paul stand, you can hear their rap skills are lacking to put it politely. By comparison, KSI's flows are a lot smoother, the tone of his voice much meaner. So at the very least, KSI has met this bar of quality set by other trap wrappers who have a deal and a very expensive chain with like a gem and crusted sponge-bob character hanging off of it. I often cringe at pop wrappers who force themselves into this style just because Drake helped popularize a more gentrified version of it. No where near is raw as the early soundclouds stuff that put these guys on the map, but the similar energy there that KSI effectively plays off of with his performance on the track pretty well. Whereas KSI's singing as opposed to his rapping is not quite as good. And he certainly has accomplishments worth bringing up and his vocal delivery is so expressive on this one. The track undefeated where it sounds like KSI is wrapping his ass off a little bit with a lot of passion that's great but the vocals are mixed incredibly low on this cut and they are slathered in auto tune 2 which makes it difficult to really connect with them in any meaningful way. ",
            "originality": "There are some tracks here that have a bit of a Travis Scott vibe, especially on the song Cap where I would say that KSI is blatantly ripping off Travis Scott as well as a really abusing the auto tune on this one. Deeper into this short project though, he fails to make a case for his own originality. Now while I find this track listenable it's just not very groundbreaking not very memorable it's got a lot of name recognition obviously but beyond that not much else. If it is that I think that there is still a lot of work to be done and while I'm sure that KSI's fan base will drive this project into some major numbers I'm not hearing right now what makes him unique and essential as a musician.

        },
        "If you don't give your audience the opportunity to connect with you on a deeper level they're just going to move on to something else. That KSI's empire on the internet is a multimedia empire so who knows if you really need his music to hit like that in order for it to be a successful venture. I mean I guess there were some tracks from this thing that I liked and I thought were cool but at the end of the day I'm left wondering is this a passion project a vanity project or is it an attempt at something greater in the music world? If it is that I think that there is still a lot of work to be done and while I'm sure that KSI's fan base will drive this project into some major numbers I'm not hearing right now what makes him unique and essential as a musician. But more time and effort I'm sure could help hammer that out feeling a strong for to a light five on this one. Tran. Zition have you given this album a listen",
